# 🚀 **Gold backed Stablecoin's Stress Testing Model** 🚀

## 🎯 **Objective**

Our goal is to work on the Gram project, with a primary focus on financial stress testing. This will help us understand how gold price fluctuations affect the stablecoin, providing insights into Gram's stability and adaptability under various market conditions.

## 💡 **About Gram**

Gram is an innovative stablecoin project that aims to create a digital currency tied to the value of gold. This brings stability and trust in the digital finance world. The project is spearheaded by a dedicated team that values community governance, security, and user involvement.

## 📈 **Financial Stress Testing**

The stress testing part of the project involves studying different gold price change scenarios and their effect on Gram's stability. By creating simulations of various market situations, we aim to evaluate Gram's ability to keep its value tied to gold and handle market volatility.

## 🤝 **Collaboration Approach**

- **Research Phase**: We'll conduct thorough research on past gold price data and market trends to inform our stress testing scenarios.
- **Model Development**: We'll create robust models using statistical and actuarial modeling techniques to simulate stress test scenarios.
- **Analysis and Insights**: We'll analyze the results of the stress tests to understand how Gram performs under different market conditions.
- **Recommendations**: Based on the findings from the stress tests, we'll suggest ways to improve Gram's stability and resilience.

## 🎁 **Benefits of Collaboration**

- **Improved Stability**: Stress testing will give us a better understanding of Gram's stability, which will increase user confidence and trust in the system.
